# XUID-to-UUID-MC
A simple website to convert an Xbox XUID to a Miencraft UUID for use with Geyser and Floodgate

I was tired of manually formatting the XUID to add players to the whitelist on my Geyser/Floodgate Minecraft server, so I made this simple tool to do it for me.

# To do
- ✅Add command field to copy the /fwhitelist command directly✅
- Resolve UUID from Xbox username directly
- Add toast or other notifications that are prettier
- Create module for Geyser/Floodgate (maybe out of scope)
- Add skin preview
